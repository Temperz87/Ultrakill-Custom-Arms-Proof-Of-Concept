# Featuring 4 arm variations
This mod started ast a quick and dirty proof of concept, to showcase some modded arm ideas, but I have nothing better to do, so now the arms have been refined and balanced. The arms are only accesible when cheats are turned on, so the cybergrind doesn't save your waves. This mod requires [UMM to work](https://github.com/Temperz87/ultra-mod-manager/tags).

A Serpent Arm, fires a snake after a short charge to seek out your foes, killing enemies with your punch causes more snakes to spawn.<br>
