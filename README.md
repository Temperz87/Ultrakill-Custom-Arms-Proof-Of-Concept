# Featuring 4 arm variations
This "mod" started ast a quick and dirty proof of concept, but I had nothing better to do so now the arms should be balanced. The arms are only accesible when cheats are turned on, so the cybergrind doesn't save your waves. This mod requires Bepinex to work, and an installation tutorial can be found [here](https://youtu.be/meNiXcbPh_s).
